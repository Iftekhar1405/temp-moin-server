This README file will give you proper instruction and will regularly updated with new changes.
I developed the Tipical REST Server in order to take data from Front-side and save it to Database.

  2. Then install all the packages simply doing "npm i" into the terminal.
  3. then npm start.
  4. Voila server in on to Bussiness.
  5. TO Request the server please send {email, name, phnum, message} as a body with http request in "(http://localhost:5000/api/v1/querry)".
  6. There might be a change that Databose will not authorize you the access.
